# Jordan Green ST10083222 RPDA8412 Research Project  

# Task Description:  
This repository contains the code used for the research paper titled: "Artificial Intelligence in Phishing Detection: A Comparative Study of Accuracy, Adaptability, and Practical Implications." The study evaluates the effectiveness of various artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as deep learning and machine learning, against traditional rule-based methods in detecting phishing attempts.  

# How to Install and Run the Project:    
Visual Studio Code Project ~  
Step 1  
* Ensure that your computer meets the system requirements to run Visual Studio Code.  
* Check for available disk space to accommodate the application.  
* Verify the necessary system requirements for your operating system.  

Step 2  
* Navigate to the official Visual Studio Code website at https://code.visualstudio.com/.  
* Download the latest version of Visual Studio Code suitable for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).  

Step 3  
* Review and agree to the terms and conditions presented during the installation process.  

Step 4  
* Once installed, launch Visual Studio Code from your applications menu or desktop shortcut.  
* Familiarize yourself with the user interface and available features.  

Step 5  
* To start coding, create a new file or open an existing project folder by selecting "File" > "Open Folder" rom the menu.  
* Begin coding and exploring the various functionalities offered by Visual Studio Code.  

Step 6  
* For downloading a project code from a repository, navigate to the GitHub repository link provided by the project team.  
* Clone the repository using the Git extension integrated into Visual Studio Code or download the code as a zip file.  

Step 7  
* Once downloaded, open Visual Studio Code, click on "File" > "Open Folder," and navigate to the folder containing the project code.  
* You are now ready to use Visual Studio Code for your project development.

# How to Install the Dataset Running the Code:  
Dataset ~  
Step 1:  

* Ensure you download the Kaggle "EMAIL SPAM DETECTION" dataset and place the spam.csv file in the root directory of this project.

# Code Structure:  
* Import Libraries: Imports necessary Python libraries for data analysis and visualisation.  
* Load Dataset: Loads the dataset and visualises the distribution of spam and ham messages.  
* Preprocess Text: Defines a function to clean and preprocess the text data.  
* Data Preparation: Converts labels to numerical values and extracts features for model training.  
* Split Dataset: Splits the dataset into training and test sets.  
* Rule-Based Method: Implements a baseline rule-based phishing detection method.  
* Machine Learning Model: Trains a logistic regression model for phishing detection.  
* Deep Learning Model: Trains a neural network model for phishing detection.  
* Calculate Accuracy: Evaluates and compares the accuracy of the models.  
* Confusion Matrix Visualisation: Generates confusion matrices for each model.  
* Classification Reports: Outputs classification reports for performance evaluation.  
* Chi-Square Test: Conducts a chi-square test to assess the significance of results.  
* Simulate Vulnerability Reduction: Simulates and visualises user vulnerability reduction post-AI implementation.  
* Results Interpretation: Summarizes and interprets the results of the analysis.

# Conclusion:  
This repository provides a foundational analysis of AI technologies in phishing detection compared to traditional rule-based systems. The findings emphasize the potential for AI to enhance cybersecurity measures through adaptive learning.  

# Future Work:  
Further research should explore diverse AI models, human-AI collaboration, and ethical implications in AI-driven cybersecurity frameworks.
